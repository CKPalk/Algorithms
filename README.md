# Algorithm Implementations
Implementing popular computer science algorithms. All code pieces are written in either C or C++.

### Algorithms:
* Sorting
	* [Quicksort](Source/Sorting/Quick/quick_sort.c "Quicksort implementation")
	* [Selection sort](Source/Sorting/Selection/selection_sort.c "Selection sort implementation")
	* [Insertion sort](Source/Sorting/Insertion/insertion_sort.c "Insertion sort implementation")
	* [Bubble sort](Source/Sorting/Bubble/bubble_sort.c "Bubble sort implementation")
